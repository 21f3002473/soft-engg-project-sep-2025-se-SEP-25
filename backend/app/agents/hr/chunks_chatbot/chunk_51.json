{"text": "Legal compliance is another critical consideration when deciding to fire an employee. Employment laws vary by jurisdiction and may impose restrictions on termination, particularly with regard to discrimination, retaliation, wrongful dismissal, contractual obligations, and notice periods. HR professionals and managers should be thoroughly familiar with relevant labor laws, internal policies, and industry regulations to ensure that termination decisions do not expose the organization to legal liability. Documentation plays a key role in this process, including maintaining records of performance evaluations, disciplinary actions, warnings, communications, and any support or training provided to the employee, as these documents provide objective evidence to justify the termination decision and demonstrate adherence to due process."}
