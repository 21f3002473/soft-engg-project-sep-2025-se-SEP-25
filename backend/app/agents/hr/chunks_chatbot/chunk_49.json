{"text": "Organizational or strategic factors may also necessitate firing employees, even when performance and behavior are acceptable. Situations such as company restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, or shifts in strategic focus can result in redundancies or elimination of roles. While these circumstances are not the fault of individual employees, they still require careful management, communication, and legal compliance to mitigate potential legal risks and preserve employee morale. Transparency, empathy, and adherence to contractual obligations, severance policies, and applicable labor laws are critical in such cases, and organizations often provide support in the form of outplacement services, career counseling, and adequate notice periods to ease the transition for affected employees."}
