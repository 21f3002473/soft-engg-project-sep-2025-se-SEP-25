{"text": "Proactive strategies can also reduce the need for terminations. Regular performance reviews, ongoing feedback, clear goal setting, skills development programs, mentorship, and effective communication channels help identify and address issues before they escalate to the point of requiring dismissal. Creating a culture of accountability, continuous learning, and open dialogue encourages employees to seek guidance, improve their performance, and align with organizational expectations, thereby minimizing the frequency and impact of terminations. Additionally, fostering engagement, recognition, and motivation can preempt behavioral or performance-related challenges, reinforcing commitment and loyalty.", "domain": "HR", "topic": "Termination"}
