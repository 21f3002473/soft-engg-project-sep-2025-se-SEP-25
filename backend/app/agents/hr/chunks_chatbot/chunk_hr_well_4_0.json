{"text": "Compliance with labor laws, regulations, and ethical standards is another crucial purpose of HR. Organizations operate within complex legal frameworks that govern employment practices, workplace safety, discrimination, data privacy, and employee rights. HR professionals are responsible for ensuring that the organization adheres to these regulations to mitigate legal risks, avoid penalties, and uphold ethical standards. This includes maintaining accurate records, conducting audits, providing training on legal and regulatory requirements, and advising management on HR-related legal issues. By ensuring compliance, HR not only protects the organization legally but also promotes a fair and ethical workplace, reinforcing trust between employees and management.", "domain": "HR", "topic": "Employee Well-being"}
