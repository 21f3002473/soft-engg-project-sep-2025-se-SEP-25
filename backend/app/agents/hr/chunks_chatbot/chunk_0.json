{"text": "Human Resources (HR) serves as a critical function within organizations, acting as the bridge between the management and the workforce, and its general purpose encompasses a wide range of strategic, operational, and developmental responsibilities that collectively aim to optimize the performance and well-being of both employees and the organization. At its core, HR exists to ensure that the organization has the right people, with the right skills, in the right positions, at the right time, thereby supporting the organization\u2019s overarching goals and mission. One of the primary purposes of HR is workforce planning and talent acquisition, which involves identifying the current and future human capital needs of the organization, sourcing potential candidates, conducting recruitment processes, and selecting individuals whose skills, experience, and cultural fit align with the organization\u2019s objectives. This process is not merely administrative but strategic, as hiring the right employees can significantly influence organizational success, productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. HR professionals design job descriptions, conduct interviews, implement selection assessments, and negotiate employment terms, all while ensuring fairness, equity, and compliance with employment laws and regulations."}
