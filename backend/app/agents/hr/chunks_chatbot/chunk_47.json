{"text": "Another situation warranting potential termination is violation of company policies, ethical codes, or legal regulations, which can include behaviors such as harassment, discrimination, theft, dishonesty, breach of confidentiality, misuse of company resources, or repeated non-compliance with workplace rules. Such infractions are often considered grounds for immediate or expedited dismissal, particularly when they compromise the safety, security, or integrity of the organization, its employees, or its clients. However, even in cases of misconduct, organizations must ensure that due process is followed, which typically involves investigating allegations thoroughly, collecting evidence, providing the employee with an opportunity to explain or defend their actions, and consulting relevant policies and legal frameworks to avoid wrongful termination claims. Termination decisions based on behavioral issues should also consider the context, frequency, and severity of the misconduct, as well as whether progressive disciplinary measures such as verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, or mandatory training have been appropriately applied before reaching the point of dismissal."}
