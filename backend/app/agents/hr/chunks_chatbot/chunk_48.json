{"text": "Cultural and values misalignment can also be a reason for termination, though it is more nuanced and often arises over a longer period. Employees who consistently demonstrate attitudes or behaviors that conflict with the organization\u2019s mission, vision, and core values\u2014such as a lack of collaboration, inability to work in teams, resistance to feedback, or undermining leadership\u2014may negatively impact team dynamics, morale, and productivity. While these situations may not constitute a legal or ethical violation, prolonged misalignment can create systemic issues that affect overall organizational health, and managers should attempt to address these challenges through coaching, mentoring, and role adjustments before considering termination, ensuring that the decision is well-documented and defensible if questioned."}
