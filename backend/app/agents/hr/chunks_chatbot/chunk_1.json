{"text": "Beyond recruitment, HR plays a central role in employee onboarding, training, and development. Once employees are hired, they must be integrated effectively into the organization, familiarized with its culture, policies, procedures, and expectations, and provided with the necessary resources to perform their roles efficiently. HR designs and implements training programs, mentorship opportunities, and career development plans that help employees acquire new skills, improve performance, and prepare for future roles within the organization. This focus on learning and development not only enhances individual capabilities but also contributes to overall organizational resilience, adaptability, and innovation. Additionally, HR facilitates performance management by establishing clear performance expectations, designing appraisal systems, conducting regular evaluations, and providing constructive feedback. By monitoring employee performance and aligning it with organizational objectives, HR ensures accountability, recognizes achievements, and identifies areas for improvement, thereby driving productivity and employee engagement."}
