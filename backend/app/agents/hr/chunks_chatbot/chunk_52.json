{"text": "Emotional intelligence and communication skills are also crucial when executing a termination. The act of firing an employee should be conducted respectfully, privately, and professionally, focusing on objective reasons rather than personal judgments, and offering clear explanations, next steps, and any applicable support, such as severance packages, references, or outplacement assistance. Managers should prepare for potential emotional responses, remain calm and empathetic, and avoid debates or confrontations that could escalate tensions. A well-handled termination not only minimizes legal and reputational risks but also helps the remaining workforce perceive the process as fair and principled, preserving morale and trust."}
