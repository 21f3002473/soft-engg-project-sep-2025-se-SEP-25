{"text": "Compensation and benefits management is another fundamental purpose of HR, as it ensures that employees are fairly and competitively rewarded for their contributions. HR designs salary structures, incentive programs, bonuses, and benefits packages that attract and retain top talent, motivate employees, and maintain internal equity and external competitiveness. This aspect of HR also involves conducting market analyses, reviewing pay scales, and ensuring compliance with labor laws and regulations regarding wages, benefits, and working conditions. By providing fair compensation and a comprehensive benefits program, HR contributes to employee satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, which are critical for reducing turnover and maintaining organizational stability."}
